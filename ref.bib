  abstract = {We propose a methodology to take dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models to the data based on the combination of differentiable state-space models and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler. First, we introduce a method for implicit automatic differentiation of perturbation solutions of DSGE models with respect to the model's parameters. We can use the resulting output for various tasks requiring gradients, such as building an HMC sampler, to estimate first- and second-order approximations of DSGE models. The availability of derivatives also enables a general filter-free method to estimate nonlinear, non-Gaussian DSGE models by sampling the joint likelihood of parameters and latent states. We show that the gradient-based joint likelihood sampling approach is superior in efficiency and robustness to standard Metropolis-Hastings samplers by estimating a canonical real business cycle model, a real small open economy model, and a medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.},

After introducing a general framework for dealing with DSGE models, the state-space representation, we discuss how to evaluate moments or the likelihood function implied by such a structure. We discuss, in varying degrees of detail, recent advances in the field, such as the tempered particle filter, approximated Bayesian computation, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, variational inference, and machine learning. These methods show much promise but have not been fully explored by the DSGE community yet. We conclude by outlining three future challenges for this line of research.},

  abstract      = {One basic feature of aggregate data is the presence of time-varying variance in real and nominal variables. Periods of high volatility are followed by periods of low volatility. For instance, the turbulent 1970s were followed by the much more tranquil times of the great moderation from 1984 to 2007. Modeling these movements in volatility is important to understand the source of aggregate fluctuations, the evolution of the economy, and for policy analysis. In this chapter, we first review the different mechanisms proposed in the literature to generate changes in volatility similar to the ones observed in the data. Second, we document the quantitative importance of time-varying volatility in aggregate time series. Third, we present a prototype business cycle model with time-varying volatility and explain how it can be computed and how it can be taken to the data using likelihood-based methods and non-linear filtering theory. Fourth, we present two "real life" applications. We conclude by summarizing what we know and what we do not know about volatility in macroeconomics and by pointing out some directions for future research.},

  abstract  = {This chapter describes various Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for exploring the posterior distributions generated by continuous-time asset pricing models. The MCMC methods are particularly well suited for continuous-time finance applications for several reasons. MCMC is a unified estimation procedure, which simultaneously estimates both parameters and latent variables. MCMC directly computes the distribution of the latent variables and parameters given the observed data and allows the researcher to quantify estimation and model risk. Estimation risk is the inherent uncertainty present in estimating parameters or state variables, while model risk is the uncertainty over model specification. The simplest MCMC algorithm is called the Gibbs sampler, which requires one to conveniently draw from the complete set of conditional distributions. In many cases, implementing the Gibbs sampler requires drawing random variables from standard continuous distributions such as normal, t, beta, or gamma or discrete distributions such as binomial, multinomial, or Dirichlet. The Griddy Gibbs sampler is an approximation that can be applied to approximate the conditional distribution by a discrete set of points. The Metropolis{\textendash}Hastings algorithm allows the functional form of the density to be nonanalytic, where one only has to evaluate the true density at two given points. Random-walk Metropolis is the original algorithm considered by Metropolis et al. in 1953, and it is the mirror image of the independence Metropolis{\textendash}Hastings algorithm.},
